# Binaries

Place packaged installers (DMG/ZIP) here when you want them tracked in Git.

Recommended flow:
1) Build locally with `npm run dist`
2) Copy the artifacts from `dist/` into this folder
3) Commit and push

Note: This folder is tracked so future pushes will not remove existing files unless you delete them intentionally.
